# TRIHook
A hook into a few games made by Terminal Reality Inc:  Monster Truck Madness 2, 4x4 Evolution, and 4x4 Evolution 2.

# What does it do?
- Adds FPS limiting (physics are FPS dependent in these games)
- Adds widescreen support to 4x4 Evolution 2
- Adds logging into a file and to a console window (Optionak)
- Adds the ability to skip input devices during problematic input device code
- Expands the default limit of 8 audio devices, this was easily exceeded as each physical device would get 2 devices in the EVO games (WaveOut, and DirectSound)

# Where do I get it?
Currently builds are available on the 4x4evolution.net site at https://www.4x4evolution.net/doku.php?id=trihook
